# A Poem

this is a poem dedicating to `sed`,
a less-known sibling of `grep` and `|`.
so simple it is,
yet so beautiful it is.

1. day I met `sed`,
2. of us wandered at
3. way cross-road,
4. a brighter scene

of the *remote* future.
"*You*" she said, "*I*" I echoed,
our feeling so **strong**,
with the beat of our **song**.

this way we *k\*ssed* each other.
